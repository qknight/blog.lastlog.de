# issue 1


i've adapted to a nixos only desktop and i'm facing new problems every day, lately i wanted to use kdevelop but it wasn't able to import a normal 'Makefile'based project. next i installed lots of packages somehow mentioned at [1]. still that alone didn't help so i ran:


    kbuildsycoca4


kbuildsycoca4 is a utility which generates a cache of .desktop files and such to be used by programs. PovAddict#kde-devel@irc.freenode.net recommended to set KDEDIRS correctly because when doing so running kbuildsycoca4 manually wouldn't be neccessary.

not sure how to solve this problem correctly yet but in case i find out i will add it to this post.

**update: 30.06.2012**

in /etc/nixos/configuration.nix write:

    environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
      kde4.kdevelop
    ];

**after nixos-rebuild kdevelop will have makefile and cmake support.** however, at least for proper cmake support, needed when kdevelop should build the project, you will need to **prepare a decent environment where all the needed programs and dependencies are listed**, see [2]


# issue 2


another point which bugs me is that auto-completion doesn't work correctly as there is no such thing as /usr/include on nixos as one might expect when coming from a different linux distribution. didn't find a solution here yet either...

**update: 30.06.2012 - found a nice solution to this problem, just have a look at [2] as well**
