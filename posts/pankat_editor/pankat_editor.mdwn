[[!summary pankat is a static blog generator with integrated live pandoc preview]]

# motivation

the [pankat](https://github.com/nixcloud/pankat) static blog generator is my improvement over the tools i used before: [ikiwiki](https://ikiwiki.info/) and [wordpress](https://wordpress.com/de/).
i love **writing offline**, **tool assisted** and **articles are versioned** using [git](https://git-scm.com/).

## pankat-static

from the documents source (mdwn) a call to `./pankat-static` will create the documents (html):

## pankat-server

`./pankat-server` is a webserver with traditional REST API but also a websocket API which allows live preview of the article.

### live preview

this is `pankat-server` with 'goland' text editor on the left and firefox on the right. but you can use any text editor and it works best if it has auto-save, which is supported by [kate](https://kate-editor.org/de/) for instance.

<source src="posts/pankat_editor/live-demo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
<p>Your browser does not support the video tag.</p>
</video>



note: this is not WYSIWYG as you can't edit the preview but it's a great way to see the result of your changes.

## mobile first

another important improvement was **designing the blog to be responsive and mobile friendly**. the **timeline** is a way to summarize everything that has been written in contrast to most blogs which render
several posts per page and use pagination and hide the comments. pankat focuses on a single article per page style and features an easy to use `left`/`right` keyboard navigation system.

## markdown

concise [markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) which rendered by [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) seemed a natural
 fit.

## reading AIDs

pankat has integrated

* [tocify.js](http://gregfranko.com/jquery.tocify.js/) which generates a
 table of contents automatically (not shown on mobile).date
* [anchor.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/anchor-js) which makes quoting individual sections outlined in h1,h2,h3,... easy.

## inline HTML/CSS/JS

where markdown is not enough one can use inline HTML/CSS/JS. this way one can integrate emscripten libraries or other interactive content.

```javascript
<script>
window.addEventListener('load', (event) => {
  console.log("hello world from pankat article");
});
</script>
```

<script>
window.addEventListener('load', (event) => {
  console.log("hello world from pankat article");
});
</script>

if you view the code of this article (link at the end), you can see it also executes the javascript code in the article and using `F12` in the console you can read the string output.

## pankat logo

# conclusion

there are still entries in the [roadmap](https://github.com/nixcloud/pankat/blob/future/documents/blog.lastlog.de/posts/roadmap.mdwn) i want to work out before
 i merge the [future](https://github.com/nixcloud/pankat/tree/future) branch into master.

lately i got mobile html working again thanks to help from [symisint](https://www.fiverr.com/symisint) from fiverr.

that said, i'm already using it for my blog and i'm happy with it.
