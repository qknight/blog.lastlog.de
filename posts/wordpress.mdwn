# motivation

[wordpress](https://wordpress.org) uses svn for **plugins** and **themes** but not for the translations nor the software itself. this is a short update on how to fix the situation for the translations.

# concept

this was actually the simplest thing i could come up with: **a bash script** downloads the languages in different versions and commits them to individual git branches.

1. query all 'current' versions:

        https://api.wordpress.org/core/version-check/1.7/

2. now query each version and download all files and store each 'hu_HU' version into its own branch:

        [new branch]      hr-4.0 -> hr-4.0
        [new branch]      hr-4.1 -> hr-4.1
        [new branch]      hr-4.2 -> hr-4.2
        [new branch]      hr-4.3 -> hr-4.3
        [new branch]      hr-4.4 -> hr-4.4
        [new branch]      hu_HU-4.0 -> hu_HU-4.0
        [new branch]      hu_HU-4.1 -> hu_HU-4.1
        [new branch]      hu_HU-4.2 -> hu_HU-4.2
        [new branch]      hu_HU-4.3 -> hu_HU-4.3
        [new branch]      hu_HU-4.4 -> hu_HU-4.4
