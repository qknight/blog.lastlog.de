# motivation


**this posting is about how to setup a nix prefix installation on gentoo linux**. if you do not have permission to install software on your server you can install a package manager in your home directory.

prefix distros:
	
  * [1] **gentoo prefix** (using portage)
  * [2] **nix prefix** (using nixpkgs)
  * source deployment (done manually)

# gentoo prefix


+ pros:

  * contains **many packages**
  * **great documentation**
  * **works in prefix** on: linux|mac|cygwin/interix
  * **security** related **tools** available
  * **Xorg stuff** as qt programs **will work**

- cons:

	
  * **time consuming installation**
  * **complicated**
  * linux prefix setup uses the sun solaris guide, which is .... _strange_ at first




# nix prefix


+ pros:

	
  * **binary deployment** (when **not altering**: --with-store-dir OR --localstatedir)
this is only possible if root assists installation
  * **assisted binary deployment** (when using self-made channel & a build robot as hydra)
i have not tested this but it should be possible
  * it is very **easy to experiment** with several **different versions** of a single program
  * **Xorg stuff **as qt programs **will work**

- cons:

  * because you need to change the /store path, it is mainly source deployment at first
  * no security tools
  * compared to other linux distros a very small subset of packages available (as in ebuilds)

# nix prefix - setup


download the software from [2], then follow this guide:

    tar xf nix-0.16.tar
    cd nix-0.16
    ./bootstrap
    ./configure --prefix=~/nix **--localstatedir**=~nix/state **--with-store-di**r=~/nix/store
    make
    make install

**NOTE:** --localstatedir is not visible when doing ./configure --help!

# nix prefix - how to use


next you have to add it to your PATH, do:

    bash

export PATH=~/.nix-profile/bin:$PATH


**NOTE**: you have to do this every time you want to use your prefixed nix.

this will alter your path to use program you install using 'nix-env' as:

    nix-env -i wget

this should download about 10-40 software components as gcc, binutils, libraries and finally wget. afterwards do:

    which wget

which should report: ~/.nix-profile/bin/wget
