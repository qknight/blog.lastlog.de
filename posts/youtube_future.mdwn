# youtube

- downloads in porgress dont appear in status bar nor can they be paused/resumed
- download encryption is slow af
- yt app startup is slow woth huge downloads
- ui resizes multipme times when internet is slow and ui is starting,hard to click the rigjt buttons
- view reset to beginning after scrolling down playlists and xlixking an item
- no indicator of media has been consumed already
- items in a playkisy start from beginnkng making it hard for long playkng items to resume loosing tje last positiln (long mixes,podcasts)
- items in a playlost dont show of they are downloads or not (corrupted files are not re downloaded bit streamed every yime)
- making playmists from downloads,espexiallt witj tje view scroll reset , really annoylng
- in order to assign a playmist the item has to be played
- yt starts on the home pannel while i often want to jist play downlaods in the car
- downloads cant be paused
- playlists are designed around 'streaming' and not 'downloads'

## downloads

- downloads are no real downloads:
 - they are just a cache
 - they are encrypted and the implementation scatters one big file into many small files making io performance bad
