[[!summary chatGPT: Linux is not on the desktop yet due to issues with graphic drivers, wireless LAN, updates, security mechanisms, and backups, but its lack of game support is no longer a major concern.]]

just a few thoughts why linux is not on the desktop yet.
	
  * **graphic drivers suck** (except those from intel and some other vendors' old cards)
  * wireless lan (**networkmanager **is not very good)
  * **updates** (not reinstallations of new versions) **tend to screw up **the whole system
  * the **security mechanisms are not always working** (getting better over the last years of course) but still one needs to be a pro to do them correctly without breaking the whole system
  * **backups**: dependent on your distribution this works or does not work well

in other places i see pretty good support in linux for the desktop use case. still those things i mentioned are harmful!

btw: i would like to mention that some years ago i would have argued that bringing the games to linux would make linux the 'os of choice'. this still did not happen for various reasons. but as time changed i would say this argument is not true anymore since ppl tend to have more than one computer or use game consoles for gaming.
