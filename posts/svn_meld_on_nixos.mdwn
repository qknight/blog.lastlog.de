this has been discussed on many blogs but since i had this issue twice now and especially since svn changed the parameter list and therefore many pages describing this are thus wrong, here it is again. also nobody seems to implement the workflow i like, that is:


  * on the left side is the file to be edited
  * on the right side is the new version (this file is only important while merging)

**workflow:** what ~/.meld does is to give you **MINE** and **THEIRS** for merging into MINE (MINE is the left side document). after the merge it would copy the modified **MINE** over **MERGED**. and once the conflict is marked '**resolved**' all the different files will vanish and leave a working set of files.




# .subversion/config


    merge-tool-cmd = /root/.meld


# /root/.meld


    #!/bin/sh
    ### the specified command: base theirs mine merged wcfile
    /nix/var/nix/profiles/default/bin/meld $3 $2
    # this cp copies mine to merged
    cp $3 $4
    exit 0

afterwards don't forget to make it executable & install meld of course:

    chmod u+x .meld
    nix-env -i meld

the merge:

    svn up
    Updating '.':
    A pkgs/applications/misc/gnome_terminator

    Select: (p) postpone, (df) diff-full, (e) edit,
     (mc) mine-conflict, (tc) theirs-conflict,
     (s) show all options: <strong>l</strong>



	
  1. type '**l**' (like **l**inux) on the keyboard

	
  2. on the left side is the file you want to patch, so make changes to the left side and save the document

	
  3. now close meld

	
  4. back on the shell, type '**r**' (for **r**esolved)

	
  5. continue with other conflicts
