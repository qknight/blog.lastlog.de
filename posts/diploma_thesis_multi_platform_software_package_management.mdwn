finally ... the online** publication of my diploma thesis** (DT) is here, it can be found online [1] including the source at [2].

i hope that the terminology introduced in this DT (chap 9) will be used. this is of course also true for concepts engineered in (chap 7).

    candies can be found here:
     - chap 4: components used in a package manager
     - chap 4.6: different integration levels of a package manager
     - chap 5.13: ways to replicate a system
     - chap 5.15 ff
     - chap 6.2: evopedia deployment summary
     - chap 7 (you might want to read this a few times, it is quite complex)
     - chap 9: here i introduce some new terminology in package management
               (probably a _must read_)

see also the README for in [2] for further information.
