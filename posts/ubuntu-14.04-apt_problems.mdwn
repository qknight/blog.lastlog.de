# motivation
i wanted to install **gitlab 6.5** for testing a certain feature and i came along an issue i've seen plenty of times on ubuntu. but this time it is differerent, as **i found the solution to the problem** and i wanted to share it with everyone.

# goal
my vanialla ubuntu 14.04 installation won't accept this command:

    root@gitlab-VirtualBox ~ # apt-get install -y build-essential zlib1g-dev libyaml-dev libssl-dev libgdbm-dev libreadline-dev libncurses5-dev libffi-dev curl openssh-server redis-server checkinstall libxml2-dev libxslt-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libicu-dev logrotate python-docutils pkg-config cmake
    Reading package lists... Done
    Building dependency tree       
    Reading state information... Done
    Note, selecting 'libxslt1-dev' instead of 'libxslt-dev'
    logrotate is already the newest version.
    openssh-server is already the newest version.
    pkg-config is already the newest version.
    Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
    requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
    distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
    or been moved out of Incoming.
    The following information may help to resolve the situation:
    
    The following packages have unmet dependencies:
     build-essential : Depends: dpkg-dev (>= 1.13.5) but it is not going to be installed
     checkinstall : Depends: dpkg-dev but it is not going to be installed
     libcurl4-openssl-dev : Depends: librtmp-dev but it is not going to be installed
     libssl-dev : Depends: libssl1.0.0 (= 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2) but 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.5 is to be installed
                  Recommends: libssl-doc but it is not going to be installed
     libxml2-dev : Depends: libxml2 (= 2.9.1+dfsg1-3ubuntu4) but 2.9.1+dfsg1-3ubuntu4.3 is to be installed
    E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

but i need it in order to use this machine as a development machine!
    
# solution
in short: **using 'dpkg -l' i manually search for showstoppers. once a candidate has been identified, i remove it using 'dpkg --purge --force-all pkgname' and afterwards use 'apt-get -f install' to let apt fix the installation.** to my surprise, reinstalling software, works pretty well sometimes. below i provide my complete log.

note: sometimes 'dpkg --purge' can be a bad thing, epsecially when you remove dpkg for instance. but since i was doing so in a virtual machine, it is not dangerous, as i had created a filesystem snapshot using virtualbox snapshotting.

note: **this posting is probably a very good reason to rely on package managers as nix which does not require SAT problems to be solved in order to make software components work side-by-side.**

## trail and error

first i created a subset of packages to install (binary search) trying to make the problem 'smaller':
    
    root@gitlab-VirtualBox ~ # apt-get install  zlib1g-dev libyaml-dev libssl-dev libgdbm-dev libreadline-dev libncurses5-dev                       
    Reading package lists... Done
    Building dependency tree       
    Reading state information... Done
    Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
    requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
    distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
    or been moved out of Incoming.
    The following information may help to resolve the situation:
    
    The following packages have unmet dependencies:
     libssl-dev : Depends: libssl1.0.0 (= 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2) but 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.5 is to be installed
                  Recommends: libssl-doc but it is not going to be installed
    E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

that worked, let's try to minimize it further:

    root@gitlab-VirtualBox ~ # apt-get install build-essential                                                                                      
    Reading package lists... Done
    Building dependency tree       
    Reading state information... Done
    Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
    requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
    distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
    or been moved out of Incoming.
    The following information may help to resolve the situation:
    
    The following packages have unmet dependencies:
     build-essential : Depends: dpkg-dev (>= 1.13.5) but it is not going to be installed
    E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

so dpkg-dev seems to be the problem, let's reinstall it:

    root@gitlab-VirtualBox ~ # apt-get install dpkg-dev
    Building dependency tree       
    Reading state information... Done
    Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
    requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
    distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
    or been moved out of Incoming.
    The following information may help to resolve the situation:
    
    The following packages have unmet dependencies:
     dpkg-dev : Depends: libdpkg-perl (= 1.17.5ubuntu5) but 1.17.5ubuntu5.3 is to be installed
                Recommends: build-essential but it is not going to be installed
                Recommends: fakeroot
                Recommends: libalgorithm-merge-perl but it is not going to be installed
    E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

i'm not using an unstable distribution! but anyway, the error lies in libdpkg-perl, so:

    root@gitlab-VirtualBox ~ # dpkg --purge --force-all libdpkg-perl                                                                                
    dpkg: libdpkg-perl: dependency problems, but removing anyway as you requested:
     lintian depends on libdpkg-perl; however:
      Package libdpkg-perl is to be removed.
    
    (Reading database ... 177600 files and directories currently installed.)
    Removing libdpkg-perl (1.17.5ubuntu5.3) ...
    Processing triggers for man-db (2.6.7.1-1) ...

afterwards reinstall it:

    root@gitlab-VirtualBox ~ # apt-get install dpkg-dev             
    Reading package lists... Done
    Building dependency tree       
    Reading state information... Done
    You might want to run 'apt-get -f install' to correct these:
    The following packages have unmet dependencies:
     dpkg-dev : Depends: libdpkg-perl (= 1.17.5ubuntu5) but it is not going to be installed
                Recommends: build-essential but it is not going to be installed
                Recommends: fakeroot
                Recommends: libalgorithm-merge-perl but it is not going to be installed
     lintian : Depends: libdpkg-perl but it is not going to be installed
    E: Unmet dependencies. Try 'apt-get -f install' with no packages (or specify a solution).

that fails of course, so we do as advised:

    root@gitlab-VirtualBox ~ # apt-get -f install

    Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
    requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable

    The following information may help to resolve the situation:

and fail again but with libssl1.0.0:
