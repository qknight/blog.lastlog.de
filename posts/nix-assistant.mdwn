# motivation
yesterday i was watching the New Horizons Mission Update - July 13, 2015 [1] and learned many new things. among them how most nix related projects got their names ;-)

**in this posting i want to share some of mine nix related documentation news** which is:

* nixos options search [2] is now available for offline use
* wiki.nixos.org [3] also! 

# the story

starting back at the zidanca sprint [4] i had the idea of making the wiki available offline and since i was very much into qt and thus using 'qt assistant' i wanted it to be as cool as the qt docs.

so here are the first results:

[[!img media/nix-assistant1.jpg caption="qt assistant with wiki.nixos.org data"]]

[[!img media/nix-assistant2.jpg caption="qt assistant with options search (showing javascript is working inside assistant)"]]

[[!img media/nix-assistant3.jpg caption="qt assistant with full text search"]]

# downloads

you can download these files:

* <https://nixcloud.io/nix-assistant/options.qch>
* <https://nixcloud.io/nix-assistant/wiki.qch>

download it:

    % wget https://nixcloud.io/nix-assistant/options.qch
    % wget https://nixcloud.io/nix-assistant/wiki.qch

then install:

    % nix-env -i qt-full

and import the documentation:

    % assistant -register options.qch 
    % assistant -register wiki.qch 

finally, launch assistant:

    % assistant

# conclusion

how i did it:

since i don't have access to the mysql dumps i was forced to use phantomjs/casperjs to query the data. turns out that casperjs and in particular javascript is a very nice combination for scraping webpages!

you can find the source code at github [5].

issues:

* **license for the wiki is currently unknown?! ;P**
* **images and some article types are not included in the wiki yet**
* <strike>**toolchain not published yet**</strike>, update: see [5]
* **not completely automated yet**
* make 'qt assistant' a standalone download or consider 'zealdocs' [6]

i hope to get most of these things fixed soon!
