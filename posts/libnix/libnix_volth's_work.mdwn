# motivation

status of **native windows nix using MinGW** from my series [libnix](https://lastlog.de/blog/timeline.html?filter=series::libnix)

[last post](libnix_mingw_status.html) we were looking into nix on windows from the *nix master branch* which uses MinGW.

**in this post we'll focus on volth's work running nix on windows back in the year 2020.**

# introduction

[volth](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/volth) *ported nix to windows* in ~2020.

using `nix-build` you could build **boost 1.74** using a **msvc 2019 toolchain**:

```cmd
\bin\nix-build.exe --keep-failed --option system x86_64-windows -o x86_64-boost -E
   "with (import <nixpkgs> { }); pkgsMsvc2019.boost174.override{ staticRuntime=true; static=true; }"
```

sadly it wasn't merged into upstream nix. now, let's see how this was actually done!

## nix windows branch

* <https://github.com/nix-windows/nix/tree/windows>

branch diff (all commits combined):

* <https://github.com/nix-windows/nix/compare/0538e1dfb1094ffe31805ad28aaf5040b27cf562..5482a4ca09f2b337e51d9f9cdcc0c77ab8451c23>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">

</div>

## nixpkgs-windows

* <https://github.com/nix-windows/nixpkgs> (called **nixpkgs-windows** in the source)

branch diff (all commits combined):

* <https://github.com/nix-windows/nixpkgs/compare/3102742718360360b4d8e5ba3d42ac591b6378e4..dc7ea0147fc07a391d15564e5f133e81095d57f4>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
270 commits, started late 2018. 133 changed files, showing +41167 additions and -1071 deletions.
</div>

## volth's windows nix capabilities

* **build nix 2.1.3 from native windows** using mingw+meson based toolchain
* a [single user setup](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/installation/installing-binary#single-user-installation) -> no nix-daemon implementation
* probably using **visual studio** for development
* probably used **cmd** (build-meson-32-mt.cmd) because for powershell this would be called (build-meson-32-mt.ps)
* **featured msvc and mingw compilers**
* **meson build system for nix** (replacing autotools), let's have a closer look at this:

    there have been proposals for other build systems over the years:

    * <https://lastlog.de/blog/replacing_automake_by_cmake.html> my attempt of autotools replacement using **CMake** in nix - early 2011
    * <https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/1427> autotools replacement using **CMake** - PR from mid 2017
    * <https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/2503> **build system discussions** - from late 2018
    * <https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/3160> **PR: Port Nix to Meson** - late 2019
    * <https://github.com/nix-windows/nix/commits/windows/> autotools replacement using **Meson** - commits from ~2020

    <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
    in upstream [nix](https://github.com/NixOS/nix) `autotools` is a requirement. `autotools` can't be used on native windows!
    i've always seen `autotools` as *ancient technology*, acting as a *vendor lock-in* for gnu/unix systems.

    the MinGW setup, which is discussed in the libnix series, has a clever workaround to this problem: a cross-compiler setup which
    comes with the downside, that it only works *from* linux/mac. WSL2/[nixos-wsl](https://github.com/nix-community/NixOS-WSL)
    makes this downside weight a little less, still it hurts!

    **either `Meson` or `CMake` as replacement for `autotools` build system are mandatory for the windows nix port in order to compile nix from windows directly.**

    a clear case for this quote:

    > spock: "the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, ..., or the one"
    </div>

### nix builtins for external programs
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
in the nix programming language, `builtins` are functions which can be called, but which are not written in the nix language themselves.
</div>

  * `runProgram()` was replaced by `runProgramGetStdout()` which could call `git`, `hg`, `tar`, `unzip`, `xz`, `gzip`, `tr`
    * `builtins.fetchGit` -> src/libexpr/primops/fetchGit.cc
    * `builtins.fetchMercurial` -> src/libexpr/primops/fetchMercurial.cc
    * `builtins.fetchurl` / `nix-prefetch-url` -> src/nix-prefetch-url/nix-prefetch-url.cc - calls `unzip` / `tar`
  * origin of the tools `git`, `hg`, `tar`, `unzip` is unclear: i guess some are from `cygwin` while others are form `mingw64` installation.

### supported nix commands

looking at the build system, checking the the source files for patches i conclude:

working:

* [x] nix-prefetch-url
* [x] nix-instantiate
* [x] nix-build
* [x] nix-store

not working:

* [ ] nix-daemon
* [ ] nix-channel
* [ ] nix-shell
* [ ] nix-collect-garbage
* [ ] nix-env
* [ ] nix-hash
* [ ] nix-copy-closure

working `nix` subcommands:

* [x] run
* [x] nar cat
* [x] nar ls
* [x] nar dump-path
* [x] hash
* [x] log
* [x] search
* [x] why-depends
* [x] store ping
* [x] store verify

not working `nix` subcommands

* [ ] repl
* [ ] store gc

**note:** this list is incomplete but still gives a broad overview. for instance, it seems that `nix build` was not supported, but the program `nix-build` was.

### stdenv

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
the `stdenv` is a build-environment, which sets environment variables as PATH to build software. a minimalistic installation of a compiler basically.
</div>

volth maintained these envs:

  * [pkgs/stdenv/default.nix](https://github.com/nix-windows/nixpkgs/blob/windows/pkgs/stdenv/default.nix)
  * [pkgs/stdenv/windows/mingw.nix](https://github.com/nix-windows/nixpkgs/blob/windows/pkgs/stdenv/windows/mingw.nix)
  * [pkgs/development/mingw-modules/msys-pacman-x86_64.nix](https://github.com/nix-windows/nixpkgs/blob/windows/pkgs/development/mingw-modules/msys-pacman-x86_64.nix)
  * [pkgs/development/mingw-modules/mingw-pacman-x86_64.nix](https://github.com/nix-windows/nixpkgs/blob/windows/pkgs/development/mingw-modules/mingw-pacman-x86_64.nix)


those are used in the file **build-meson-32-mt.cmd** and supposedly buildable:

* pkgsMsvc2019.stdenv.cc
* pkgsMsvc2019.boost174
* pkgsMsvc2019.openssl
* pkgsMsvc2019.xz
* pkgsMsvc2019.bzip2
* pkgsMsvc2019.curl
* pkgsMsvc2019.sqlite
* msysPacman.flex
* msysPacman.bison
* mingwPacman.meson

however: using these *stdenvs* one could attempt a build of any software in nixpkgs so we can't know what builds without trying.
it is really worth pointing out that volth's boost's [volths generic.nix](https://github.com/nix-windows/nixpkgs/blob/windows/pkgs/development/libraries/boost/generic.nix)
looks nothing like the original [upstream generic.nix](https://github.com/nix-windows/nixpkgs/blob/e3de8a92325620e65039d98281047a83fa07c9dd/pkgs/development/libraries/boost/generic.nix).

### static vs. dynamic linking inside nixpkgs

looking at [volths generic.nix](https://github.com/nix-windows/nixpkgs/blob/windows/pkgs/development/libraries/boost/generic.nix):

```nix
installPhase = ''
  print("EXEC: b2 ${b2Args} install\n");
  die $! if system("b2 ${b2Args} install");
  renameL("$ENV{out}/include/boost-".('${version}' =~ s/^(\d+)\.(\d+).*/$1_$2/r)."/boost", "$ENV{out}/include/boost") or die $!;
  rmdirL("$ENV{out}/include/boost-".('${version}' =~ s/^(\d+)\.(\d+).*/$1_$2/r))                                      or die $!;
'' + stdenv.lib.optionalString (!static) ''
  mkdirL("$ENV{out}/bin") or die $!;
  for my $dll (glob("$ENV{out}/lib/*.dll")) {
    renameL($dll, "$ENV{out}/bin/".basename($dll)) or die $!;
  }
'';
```
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
using the perl [renameL](https://metacpan.org/pod/Win32::LongPath#renameL-OLDNAME,NEWNAME) function volth copied all *dll* files into the *bin* directory.
there is no [rpath](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/107888/is-there-a-windows-msvc-equivalent-to-the-rpath-linker-flag) concept on windows.
</div>

## MinGW vs. msvc toolchain

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
the main difference between these two toolchains on windows are performance, developer experience (debugging), API availability and licensing.
</div>

i never worked with visual studio / msvc much but **for the purpose of [libnix](https://lastlog.de/blog/timeline.html?filter=series::libnix), i think MinGW is a good choice for porting nix and create a custom MinGW toolchain inside nix**
should be sufficient.

### corepkgs/config.nix

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
config.nix shows a variety of tools/locations of his bootstrapping environment. i personaly would like to see a **"c:\\"** instead of unix paths **"/"**.
</div>

```nix
let
  fromEnv = var: def:
    let val = builtins.getEnv var; in
    if val != "" then val else def;
in rec {
  shell = "/usr/bin/bash";
  coreutils = "/usr/bin";
  bzip2 = "/mingw64/bin/bzip2";
  gzip = "/usr/bin/gzip";
  xz = "/mingw64/bin/xz";
  tar = "/usr/bin/tar";
  tarFlags = "--warning=no-timestamp";
  tr = "/usr/bin/tr";
  nixBinDir = fromEnv "NIX_BIN_DIR" "/usr/bin";
  nixPrefix = "/usr";
  nixLibexecDir = fromEnv "NIX_LIBEXEC_DIR" "/usr/libexec";
  nixLocalstateDir = "/nix/var";
  nixSysconfDir = "/usr/etc";
  nixStoreDir = fromEnv "NIX_STORE_DIR" "/nix/store";

  # If Nix is installed in the Nix store, then automatically add it as
  # a dependency to the core packages. This ensures that they work
  # properly in a chroot.
  chrootDeps =
    if dirOf nixPrefix == builtins.storeDir then
      [ (builtins.storePath nixPrefix) ]
    else
      [ ];
}
```

### nix.exe

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
`nix.exe` follows the unix principle of 'putting all the functionality into one binary'.

volth put some effort into this by getting some subcommands for `nix.exe` working.
</div>

#### run.cc

volth put some effort into `run(ref<Store> store) override` function for getting it to work on windows

```c++
    void run(ref<Store> store) override
    {
        auto outPaths = toStorePaths(store, Build, installables);
    ...
```

#### main.cc

```c++
#ifdef _WIN32
    if (boost::algorithm::iends_with(programName, ".exe")) {
        programName = programName.substr(0, programName.size()-4);
    }
#endif
```

#### ls.cc

```c++
void listText(ref<FSAccessor> accessor)
{
    std::function<void(const FSAccessor::Stat &, const Path &, const std::string &, bool)> doPath;

    auto showFile = [&](const Path & curPath, const std::string & relPath) {
        if (verbose) {
            auto st = accessor->stat1(curPath);
            std::string tp =
                st.type == FSAccessor::Type::tRegular ? (
#ifndef _WIN32
                    st.isExecutable ? "-r-xr-xr-x" :
#endif
                    "-r--r--r--") :
```

### libexpr

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
**chatGPT:** `libexpr` typically refer to the library that handles nix expressions. nix expressions are a domain-specific language (DSL) used in nix and nixos for defining packages, configurations, and system setups.

very few changes were required here!
</div>

* `Path EvalState::coerceToPath(const Pos & pos, Value & v, PathSet & context)`

    ```c++
    Path EvalState::coerceToPath(const Pos & pos, Value & v, PathSet & context)
    {
        string path = coerceToString(pos, v, context, false, false);
    #ifdef _WIN32
        if (path.length() >= 7 && path[0] == '\\' && path[1] == '\\' && (path[2] == '.' || path[2] == '?') && path[3] == '\\' &&
                   ('A' <= path[4] && path[4] <= 'Z') && path[5] == ':' && isslash(path[6])) {
            return path;
        }
        if (path.length() >= 3 && (('A' <= path[0] && path[0] <= 'Z') || ('a' <= path[0] && path[0] <= 'z')) && path[1] == ':' && isslash(path[2])) {
            return path;
        }
        throwEvalError("string '%1%' doesn't represent an absolute path, at %2%", path, pos);
    #endif
    ```
* `std::pair<string, string> decodeContext(const string & s)`

### libutil

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
**chatGPT:** `libutil` is platform abstraction: these libraries may abstract away platform-specific details and provide a consistent interface for
interacting with the underlying operating system.
this can help ensure portability and make it easier to maintain and support Nix across different platforms.

all changes are for platform/path handling.
</div>

src/libutil/util.cc, namely:

* `std::string to_bytes(const std::wstring & path) {`
* `std::wstring from_bytes(const std::string & s) {`
* `optional<std::wstring> maybePathW(const Path & path) {`
* `std::wstring pathW(const Path & path) {`
* `std::wstring handleToFileName(HANDLE handle) {`
* `Path handleToPath(HANDLE handle) {`
* `std::string WinError::addLastError(const std::string & s)`
* `std::wstring getCwdW()`
* `std::wstring getArgv0W()`
* `std::wstring getEnvW(const std::wstring & key, const std::wstring & def)`
* `string getEnv(const string & key, const string & def)`
* `std::map<std::wstring, std::wstring, no_case_compare> getEntireEnvW()`
* `Path absPath(Path path, Path dir)`
* `Path canonPath(const Path & path, bool resolveSymlinks) {`
* `Path canonNarPath(const Path & path)`

### libstore

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
**chatGPT:** `libstore` is a library that provides functionality related to managing software on the system.
</div>

* **store implementation**:
  * <https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/store/types/local-store>
  * *C:\\nix\\store** was the store root and referenced by **/nix/store** in the code
  * src/libstore/pathlocks.cc -> openLockFile/lockFile implementation
  * src/libutil/archive.cc -> static void dump(..) implementation



### tests

tests/local.mk contains some interesting mentions:

```bash
# these do not pass (yet) on MINGW:
#  gc-concurrent.sh         <-- fails trying to delete open .lock-file, need runtimeRoots
#  gc-runtime.sh            <-- runtimeRoots not implemented yet
#  user-envs.sh             <-- nix-env is not implemented yet
#  remote-store.sh          <-- not implemented yet
#  secure-drv-outputs.sh    <-- needs nix-daemin which is not ported yet
#  nix-channel.sh           <-- nix-channel is not implemented yet
#  nix-profile.sh           <-- not implemented yet
#  case-hack.sh             <-- not implemented yet (it might have Windows-specific)
#  nix-shell.sh             <-- not implemented yet
#  linux-sandbox.sh         <-- not implemented (Docker can be use on Windows for sandboxing)
#  plugins.sh               <-- not implemented yet
#  nix-copy-ssh.sh          <-- not implemented yet
#  build-remote.sh          <-- not implemented yet
#  binary-cache.sh          <-- \* does not work in MSYS Bash (https://superuser.com/questions/897599/escaping-asterisk-in-bash-on-windows)
#  nar-access.sh            <-- not possible to have args '/foo/data' (paths inside nar) without magic msys path translation (maybe `bash -c '...'` will work?)
```

## volth's windows bash discussion

we need to create a cross-platform `stdenv` and from this discussion <https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nix-on-windows/1113> i extracted this:

* volth proposed these
  * `ruby`
  * [rakudo (Perl 6)](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nix-on-windows/1113/48) + excellent Unicode support and + works well with Windows paths, including symlinks
* [lua](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nix-on-windows/1113/60) is proposed by john ericson
* [oil shell](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nix-on-windows/1113/75) - GSH, a non-interactive POSIX shell for Windows
* nushell mentioned in recent times
  * `nushell` see <https://determinate.systems/posts/nuenv/> from luc perkins (see also the [nixcon23 talk on YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwElUltNsq0))

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
i find `nushell` the most interesting as it contains many helper programs like `cp` and also has an [interesting programming language](https://www.nushell.sh/book/programming_in_nu.html).
</div>

# summary

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
**volth's work has been kept alive, thanks john ericson!** furthermore, john ericson even managed to already integrate parts of volth's work into nix!

**volth's amazing prototyping work shows that it is feasible to use nix on windows. thanks volth**! the code base is a huge inspiration and shows how much is already possible and where we need to focus work!

some platform limitations volth faced, and in parts even fixed, are now overcome by microsoft on windows 10 and onwards, namely:

* path length limitations
* case handling for paths/files
* directory/file permissions
* symlink support
* unix domain socket support

however, there is still some major issue to be dealt with:

* dynamic/static linking (i.e. rpath)

</div>

why was volth's work not merged into nix. these would be my (qknight's) guesses:

* inability of the nix community to recognize the true value/potential of volth's work
* politics
* fear of unmaintained code
* build system changes
* romantic linux idealism
