# motivation

**fixPath**, a tool created for **making nix store concepts possible on Windows 10**, see series [libnix](https://lastlog.de/blog/timeline.html?filter=series::libnix)

# fixPath

> `fixPath` is a tool to modify the path to a certain DLLs (Dynamic Shared Objects) for [Microsoft Windows
Executables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format) by rewriting parts of the executable's PE
header, when the `.fixPath` section is present and indicates support for such rewrite, but _without_ having to realign
the PE headers. In concept, it is similar to [patchelf](https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf) but instead of
changing search paths, fixPath hard-codes each DLL to a particular filepath.

see `fixPath` project page:

* <https://github.com/nixcloud/fixPath>

release with prebuilt fixPath.exe tool + test program:

* <https://github.com/nixcloud/fixPath/releases/tag/v0.1.0>

# why `fixPath`?

windows does not have an implementation of the [rpath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rpath) concept unix systems have.
as a result you have to move the libraries into the same folder as the executable. in theory one could use symlinks
instead of copies also. With `fixPath` you can have the libraries in the `c:\nix\store` and only have to modify the
PE header similar to patchelf on Linux.

a hope of mine is that we as a community can motivate Microsoft to continue work on rpath support for Windows but
since this requires changes on the proprietary side of the linker loader there is nothing to be done from outside
Microsoft. in that regard `fixPath` is a valuable alternative which luckly works as the library field, i.e. `KERNEL32.dll`,
inside the Imports Section supports absolute/relative paths already.

`nixPath` is the result of a blog post by Jussi, see

# PE header

the picture below shows the **SectionsHeader** in [ImHex](https://github.com/WerWolv/ImHex) with the newly added `.fixpath` section:

the picture below shows the **DLLName hint** in ImHex somewhere in `.rdata`:

note: the library names have lots of empty space so that later changes don't require PE relocations which are
very complicated.

# linker support

when using the `lld` linker (from LLVM), instead of the default `ld` linker from binutils and using this
lld branch <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/compare/release/18.x...qknight:llvm-project:libnix_PE-fixPath>,
you can get the ``.fixPath` PE section added automatically!

# how to use `fixPath`

show library status:

```bash
$ fixPath.exe -l test_mylib.exe
TARGET:
 - test_mylib.exe
 - fixPath version: 2
 - fix_path_size: 301

IMPORTS
 - 1, mylib.dll @ 0x4274
 - 2, KERNEL32.dll @ 0x43c1
 - 3, VCRUNTIME140D.dll @ 0x450e
 - 4, ucrtbased.dll @ 0x465b
DELAYED IMPORTS
 - 1, delayedlib.dll @ 0x3894
```

change `mylib.dll` library into absolute path:

```bash
$ fixPath.exe -s test_mylib.exe mylib.dll c:\some\location\mylib.dll
TARGET:
 - test_mylib.exe

UPDATE mylib.dll @ 0x4274 -> c:\some\location\mylib.dll (modified)
DONE
```

show updated library status:

```bash
fixPath.exe -l test_mylib.exe
TARGET:
 - test_mylib.exe
 - fixPath version: 2
 - fix_path_size: 301

IMPORTS
 - 1, mylib.dll @ 0x4274 -> c:\some\location\mylib.dll (modified)
 - 2, KERNEL32.dll @ 0x43c1
 - 3, VCRUNTIME140D.dll @ 0x450e
 - 4, ucrtbased.dll @ 0x465b
DELAYED IMPORTS
 - 1, delayedlib.dll @ 0x3894
```

# interesting tests

using the `fixPath` concept this works:

```
* [x] dll import supports absolute paths
* [x] dll import supports relative paths like `lib\lib.dll`
* [x] works with long filename : "c:\t\aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.dll"
* [x] works with long directory: "c:\aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\t.dll"
* [x] works with "C:\t\nix\store\zxxialnsgv0ahms5d35sivqzxqg1kicf-libiec61883-1.2.0\lib\aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.dll" 213 chars
* [x] works with "C:\t\nix\store\zxxialnsgv0ahms5d35sivqzxqg1kicf-libiec61883-1.2.0\lib\aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.dll" 269 chars
```

note: an override with absolute/relative path will always cause the linker-loader on Windows 10 to use exactly this
library and another copy with the same name in the binary's directory won't override this!

## status

* **development of fixPath concept cost me ~5 weeks**
* `fixPath` concept work **needs review**
* **LLD change needs a PR** to get it upstream
* automate fixPath concept by the build system's make install step

# summary

i hope to get developers interested in `fixPath` concepts and motivate Microsoft to also support `rpath` in PE!
