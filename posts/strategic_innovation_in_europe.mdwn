# motivation

ideas of mine to make 'europe' a 'strong strategic player'

# software

to get rid of the current software monoculture we need to introduce a open source based culture. the closed source culture keeps us dependent on the US.

there are already so many open source projects out there, we need to use them instead.

# internet

## security

* make software reproducibility a first order principle (i.e. reproducible builds via Nix)
* forbid microsoft AD usage in companies and public institutions and encourage open standards

## provider

* make ipv6 mandatory for dsl/fiber/mobile
  * with static prefix
  * ipv6
  * general SLA uptime guarantees for wired connections, no special contracts for businesses
* maximum 3 months contracts
* free choice of router
* symmetric upload/download bandwidth
* discourage the term 'flat rate', instead just have reasonable prices
* encourage [https://letsencrypt.org/](let's encrypt) usage

## roaming

* we must get rid of EU roaming fees for mobiles (also includes swiss), also make mobile voip mandatory in terms of QoS

## payment, accounting

invoice automation:

* sellers (online and offline) must be obliged to append a machine readable (json, xml) invoice for accounting during the payment process

europe needs a independent clone of:

* [paypal.com](paypal.com)
* digital payment (aka google pay)

## hosting

in europe we must have an alternative to amazon aws, google cloud, microsoft azure, digitalocean, linode

## packages and services

* germany: shift away from home-delivery default to https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paketbox and https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packstation
* create a 'europe' based alternative to amazon.com in form of a market place (i.e. google shopping)

# conclusion

this white paper only outlines a few low-hanging fruits. in regards to many topics discussed above, the netherlands is currently in the lead. they even got cool things as the [https://nlnet.nl/](nlnet.nl) initiative.
