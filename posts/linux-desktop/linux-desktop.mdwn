# motivation

waiting for the linux desktop all my life, what holds it back?

# windows desktop use-cases

* running native apps
* developing applications (native, docker, remote development)
* running applications in (automation, kiosk-mode)

# what government/corporate wants

prime feature for cooperate:

* user access management
* backup & recovery
* helpdesk (remote control)
* monitoring
* legacy software support
* software management  

# what government/corporate actually need

* moving from
  * paper driven workflows
  * moving from office tools to webforms
* shift in IT work
  * move from AD to oauth for webservices for authentication
  * move away from windows centric lock-in tooling
  * cloud first
    * git workflows
    * cooperative tools like google docs, https://excalidraw.com or replit.com
    * reproducible tooling like nix
  * we need more programmers creating simple frontends & database replacing paper driven workflows
  * dynamic rights management, spin up servers with webapps & change parts in DNS



most important in IT:
* more risk taking, more failing & recovering

# technical challenges

* updates (windows)
  * OS updates (triggerd by OS update scheduler)
  * signal, brave, ... (apps detect that they need updates, either by scheduler or manual check button)
    * note: only _that_ app updates
* updates (nixos) - only console tools, horrible ux
  * nixos-rebuild switch
  * home-manager
  * flatpak (foreign)
* avoiding lock-in
  * relevant
    * office 365
    * active directory
    * .net
    * exclusive contracts
  * historically
    * gaming platform: directx
    * exclusive hardware support (3d drivers, power management, driver support in general)
    * windows server
    * internet exlorer
* deployment
  * source deployment
  * binary deployment, aka closed source support
    * cross linux support (all need libnix)
      * snap packages (canonical)
      * appimage (community-driven)
      * flatpak (community-driven, some Red Hat fund)
      * docker
* running old stuff: backward compatibility
  * glibc, docker, kernel
  * linux "dll" hell
* running windows programs
  * proton
* graphis drivers restarts on crashes: windows uses a unified driver model, like WDM for soundcards and WDDM for graphics cards
* linux stability
* hardware support
  * cuda support
* power management (mixed quality)
* display management and hotplugging (works on steam deck)

* ms office 
  * "paper" forms to "webpage" REST forms

* dedicated vendors
  * valve: steam deck
  * framework
  * dell
  * thinkpad
