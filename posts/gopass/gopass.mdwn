[[!summary using one password manager for multiple platforms]]

# motivation

i need a password store with these properties:

* support for multiple OSes (android/linux/windows)
* versioned (git)
* secure (gpg)
* self-hosted (simple git repo with ssh access)
* usable in teams (using several mounts, i.e. private/company store for sets of passwords)

and with [gopass](https://www.gopass.pw/) i have all of these!

in a nutshell, gopass uses git as backend, encrypts the passwords using gpg and accesses the git repo via ssh keys or passwords.
the only downside, gopass leaks the directory structure/file names, as those are not encrypted.

# how i use it

the documentation is all over the place and some issues are really hard to come by.

a good start for everyday use:

<https://woile.github.io/gopass-cheat-sheet/>

## backend

i'm using <https://github.com> repository:

* create github.com/yourname/yourrepo and make it private so not everybody can clone the repo
* add [Deploy keys](https://github.com/yourname/yourrepo/settings/keys), generated in the android app

## windows

i used *chocolatey* as described in the installation manual at:

<https://github.com/gopasspw/gopass/blob/master/docs/setup.md#windows>

    choco install gopass

## android

<https://github.com/android-password-store/Android-Password-Store>

[[!img posts/gopass/android-password-store.png width="200px" alt="" style="float: none" class="noFancy"]]

the settings:

    repository URL: git@github.com/yourname/yourrepo.git
    authentication mode: ssh key

the password store app syncs on each change, which is nice.

## linux

simply install gopass, git and gpg


# yet unsolved issues

* otp integration (still use andotp, need to check [gopass otp](https://github.com/gopasspw/gopass/blob/master/docs/features.md#adding-otp-secrets))
* ssh cert management (is there a gopass-agent?)
* is there iphone support?

# conclusion

i wish i had moved to gopass / password store years ago.

**especially sharing passwords with a team, this is an ideal solution**. major benefit is that one does not have to use ntfs file mounts, to store keepassx databases and can basically update the local copy of the db with `gopass sync` and then be offline for a while and still able to use it daily.
