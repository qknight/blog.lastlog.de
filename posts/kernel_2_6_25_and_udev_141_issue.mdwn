[[!summary chatGPT: The problem was that the system was halted due to udev not supporting the kernel version, and the fix involved downgrading udev to version 141 after booting from a grml USB stick and making some changes in the system setup.]]

#the problem:


**labsystem boot halts with this error:**

    Current udev only supports Linux kernel **2.6.25** and newer.
    Your kernel is too old to work with this version of udev.

# fix

either upgrade kernel or downgrad udev, i downgraded udev

system setup before fix was applied:
	
  * installed kernel: **2.6.23-gentoo**
  * installed   udev: **sys-fs/udev-149**

usb boot stick: **grml version: 2008.11 - Release Codename Schluchtenscheisser 2008-11-30**

    disk usage:
    /dev/sda* not important
    
    /dev/sdb1 boot,ext2
    /dev/sdb2 lvm
    
    /dev/sdc1 boot,ext2
    /dev/sdc2 lvm
    
    md0: /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1
    md1: /dev/sdb2 /dev/sdc2


# now the fix


i basically used [1] and [2] as reference. i don't like that portage didn't tell me that with a dependency issue.
	
  1. grml usb stick boot
  2. 'Start mdadm-raid' found in the bootlog on Console F1
  3. vgscan; vgchnage -ay (wait about 10-30secs)
  4. mount /dev/vg/root /mnt/root (create /mnt/root first)
  5. cd /mnt/root; chroot .
  6. emerge =sys-fs/udev/-146-r1 (did not work)
  7. emerge =sys-fs/udev/-141

     **edit /etc/portage/package.mask**

        # DON'T INSTALL udev > 141 without making a kernel update first (2010-03-18)
        sys-fs/udev-141

  8. exit; reboot


system setup after fix was applied:

  * installed kernel: 2.6.23-gentoo (not changed)
  * installed udev: sys-fs/udev-141
