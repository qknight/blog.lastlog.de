reading about spam lately makes me think even more about concentration efforts of big email hosters. what benefit would a big email provider like gmail & co have? well consider the cost for a small installation of a mailserver and the amount of time one has to spent to get spam sorted out properly.

to operate a mailserver you need someone with a high skill to do that and you gona need someone you can trust.

**i don't accuse gmail in particular but all big email hosters in general.** consider spam as a way to do legal DoS to their competitors. on the other hand big email hosters can handle spam - on the big scale - pretty well since they can filter pretty efficient.

what do you think?
