<h2 data-number="1" id="what-does-cloud-stand-for">what does ‘cloud’
stand for?</h2>
<p>simply speaking, a cloud consists similar computers (homogeneous
hardware). usually every single cloud computer runs the same OS (host
system), each controlling various guests. the main technical motivations
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>load balancing of <strong>cpu load </strong>(move the VM to a
machine with more CPU power)</li>
<li>load balancing of <strong>input/ouput load</strong> (RAM increase;
faster storage raid; in memory databases)</li>
<li>load balancing of <strong>bandwidth usage </strong>(move the VM to
the most demanding users)</li>
<li><strong>increase redundancy </strong>(reduce hardware failures;
reduce power loss issues)</li>
</ul>
<p>the main non-technical motivations seem to be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>marketing</strong> - ‘cloud’ sounds cool, although a ‘cloud’
is basically just a subset of the internet</li>
<li><strong>vendor lock-in</strong> - probably no surprise to
anyone</li>
<li><strong>centralization</strong> - cheaper to manage; grants more
control over the platform</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>if you are a customer to a service which is hosted in the
cloud </strong>you usually don’t see the cloud at all, hence the term
‘cloud’:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>amazon</strong>: when buying books or other things</li>
<li><strong>google</strong>: using google search; reading email; google
maps</li>
<li><strong>microsoft azure</strong>: whatever that platform is good
for, is actually anybody using this?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>if you are using one or more machines from a cloud,</strong>
there are basically two interesting patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>actively maintain each computer:</strong> implement
distributed file systems and distributed services</li>
<li><strong>using an abstraction: </strong>someone implemented the
handling of nodes and services you are going to develop thus it is
running on top of an abstraction</li>
</ul>
<p>to sum up, if you <strong>want to use cloud computers, you have to
decide between:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SaaS</strong> - Software as a Service (something like google
mail)</li>
<li><strong>PaaS</strong> - Platform as a Service (something like ms
azure / amazon e2)</li>
</ul>
<p>as the trend in hardware design is going towards multicore along with
NUMA it seems the cloud is undergoing similar changes. as a rule of
thumb i’d say that ‘<strong>cloud computing can be seen as an approach
to build a distributed operating system</strong>’.</p>
<h2 data-number="2" id="cloud-problems">cloud problems</h2>
<p>not too long ago you would have maintained your own infrastructure
with access to the hardware and software used. but times have changed
and the americanization of things, that is by building ‘super services’,
is about to change the internet yet again.</p>
<p>i see this issues (no special order):</p>
<h3 data-number="2.1" id="loss-of-control">loss of control</h3>
<p>this is probably the strongest argument against using third party
proprietary services as you can’t fix it when it is broken. but cloud
computing usually means a loss of privacy as well. the article [2]
mentioning various points from richard stallman and larry ellison
probably makes this point clear. it is interesting to see this SaaS
wikipedia article [3] which reads like a campaign for SaaS - probably
written by someone with a marketing background. there is the dangers to
loose your data to foreign countries, as mentioned in [7].</p>
<h3 data-number="2.2" id="loss-of-own-infrastructure">loss of own
infrastructure</h3>
<p>you don’t have your own infrastructure anymore, thus you don’t have
physical control over your devices. additionally you then depend on
working internet connections. it is likely that the infrastructure you
rely on runs in one or several different countries.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.3"
id="loss-of-software-not-designed-for-the-cloud">loss of software not
designed for the cloud</h3>
<p>the various versions of the <strong>GPL had a great influence on how
software could be used and distributed</strong> but with the advent of
the cloud this changes drastically. the way programs, especially
webservices, are designed makes the GPL concept useless as it does not
affect you at all. however, there is a new license, the ‘Affero General
Public License’ [4] which fills that gap.</p>
<p>why is wordpress is not licensed AGPL i wonder? my first guess is
laziness as every author of every single patch would have to be asked
for license change persmission. but the wordpress hosters could be using
the GPL to greenwash their software as they would not have to hand out
proprietary extension which might not be released. but who knows?!</p>
<h3 data-number="2.4"
id="loss-of-knowledge-how-to-setup-services-similar-to-todays-cloud-servcies">loss
of knowledge how to setup services similar to today’s cloud
servcies</h3>
<p>think about email - who operates his own mailserver nowadays? most
friends of mine use google mail and this implies: once you are familiar
with a service and its workflow you usually do not want to change.
especially if the service seems to be free as in google mail for example
(but most of my friends seem not to care that google replaced ‘currency’
by ‘privacy’ which is used as payment instead).</p>
<p>as a consequence the knowledge about how to run your own mail server
gets lost. if you understand german, listen to alternativlos 18 - ‘Peak
Oil, den Weltuntergang, und wie man sich vorbereiten kann’ [5]** minute
74 ff** - they discuss this issue.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.5" id="my-personal-experience">my personal
experience</h3>
<p>i have a strong tendency to use devices which are capable of bringing
me certain services offline. this is why i put a lot of effort into the
evopedia application for instance. the nokia n900 is probably another
good example where i try to maintain an offline infrastructure - i
didn’t even have mobile internet on the n900 for a complete year and yet
i was able to do most things using sip/mappero/evopedia and others.</p>
<p>here are some thoughts about online services i use:</p>
<h4 data-number="2.5.1" id="wordpress">wordpress</h4>
<p>i use <strong>wordpress.com</strong> right now and i really hate it
for these points:</p>
<ul>
<li>you <strong>can’t write offline</strong></li>
<li>initial <strong>uploading images</strong> or updating them** is a
frustrating process**</li>
<li>i sometimes <strong>loose parts of articles while
writing</strong></li>
<li>there is <strong>no good backup process </strong>for offline
backups</li>
<li>i <strong>hate the WYSIWYG editor</strong> as it does not work very
well</li>
<li><strong>wordpress is inconsitent in producing a good web 2.0
workflow</strong>, it feels like reloading the page all the time instead
of doing so for single dom-tree elements only, as it would be done with
web 2.0; if you don’t trust me, have a look at [6] - how the upcoming
wikipedia editor works</li>
</ul>
<p>of course i could host wordpress on my own webserver and i wanted to
do that for a long time. the problem is that wordpress is optimized to
be run on wordpress.com thus i think it might be too much work for me to
support it with proper security updates and plugin management.** instead
i search for a blog system which uses markdown in combination to git but
i didn’t find yet what i am searching for.**</p>
<p>don’t get me wrong, i really like wordpress but i don’t like this
dependency and lack of flexibility using their software.</p>
<h4 data-number="2.5.2" id="google-maildocs">google mail/docs</h4>
<p>i really love ‘google docs’ as it is a wonderful collaborative
platform but i can’t use it as i have to disclose all documents to
google i’d be working on.</p>
<h4 data-number="2.5.3" id="google-android">google android</h4>
<p>like google mail and google docs, android has a very good cloud
integration. but if you want to use services other than google’s, it is
a horrible platform. for instance i keep installing xabber [12] although
google uses jabber but intentionally made you require to install third
party software in order to use non google jabber. same goes for most
other services. if i had to use an android phone i would buy one with
proper CyanogenMod [13] support.</p>
<h4 data-number="2.5.4" id="github.com">github.com</h4>
<p>great service for source code hosting using git. still the platform
itself is not available like for <a
href="http://gitorious.org/">http://gitorious.org/</a> or <a
href="http://gitlabhq.com/">http://gitlabhq.com/</a>. github.com uses a
wiki which is bound to the platform and not contained in the git
repo.</p>
<p>note: although i never used <a
href="http://www.fossil-scm.org/">http://www.fossil-scm.org</a> i like
the idea that it contains a wiki in the repository as well</p>
<p>i use github.com only for free and open source projects.</p>
<h2 data-number="3" id="better-without-clouds">better without
clouds</h2>
<p>the conventional use of the term ‘cloud’ simply indicates a buzzword
or business term for vendor lock-in and centralized infrastructure you
don’t have control of. that is good to know as it helps to recognize and
avoid such services. what one should use instead is decentralized
infrastructure located near the user, connected to the internet where
needed, giving the user the control over the platform.</p>
<p>arguably this concept is implemented as a new trend called
‘<strong>personal cloud</strong>’ or ‘<strong>private cloud
server</strong>’. but these terms are limiting the trend to personal or
private matters, yet i would like to see it in businesses as well.</p>
<h3 data-number="3.1" id="hardware">hardware</h3>
<p>following the concept of decentralization <strong>users can host
their own files and other things</strong> as address books / calenders
<strong>on their own home devices</strong>.</p>
<p>a list of interesting devices to give you an idea:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>sheevaplug</strong> [9] - there is even a nixos version for
this device (by viric)!</li>
<li><strong>pogoplug</strong> [10]</li>
<li><strong>tonidoplug</strong> [11]</li>
<li><strong>fritz!box</strong> (with myfritz and fritznas) [14]</li>
</ul>
<h3 data-number="3.2" id="software">software</h3>
<h4 data-number="3.2.1" id="software-implementing-services">software
implementing services</h4>
<p>a list of software i find interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>despora</strong> [15] - decentralized facebook</li>
<li><strong>owncloud</strong> [16] - dropbox like service</li>
<li><strong>sparkleshare</strong> [21] - is a collaboration and sharing
tool that is designed to keep things simple and to stay out of your
way.</li>
<li><strong>tomahawk</strong> [19] - a nice music streaming service</li>
<li>various p2p / torrent like services:
<ul>
<li><strong>mldonkey</strong> [17]</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>still most ‘personal or private clouds’ scale differently compared to
the big 3 mentioned in the beginning of this article. for instance, most
of these services are configured in the client/server way and they
usually do not implement concepts as failover, backups or load
balancing. for that to happen it requires a new set of tools and
decentralized frameworks based on p2p technologies - which has just not
happened yet.</p>
<p>there is also a political issue: most internet users do not have a
decent upload channel, which basically means that their internet
connection is not very good.</p>
<h5 data-number="3.2.1.1" id="software-for-managing-services">software
for managing services</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>openshift</strong> [20] - is a cloud computing platform as a
service product from red hat</li>
<li><strong>openstack</strong> [21] - is a global collaboration of
developers and cloud computing technologists producing the ubiquitous
open source cloud computing platform for public and private clouds.</li>
<li><strong>disnix</strong> [8] - is a distributed deployment extension
for Nix, a purely functional package manager.</li>
</ul>
<p>i’ve used neither but i like to point out that there is ongoing open
source involvement and interestingly non of these technologies are used
in private clouds. <strong>private clouds seem to implement the
classical client/server paradigm at the moment. </strong>there is a
<strong>remarkable exception</strong>, that is <strong>filesharing using
p2p/kademlia</strong> which implements a basically read only storage
which scales pretty well already.</p>
<h3 data-number="3.3" id="a-matter-of-design">a matter of design</h3>
<p>to make the private cloud or a decentralized cloud a success we
need:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <strong>standardized package manager</strong> with proper software
life-cycle management</li>
<li><strong>symmetrical internet connections</strong> with decent
upload/download speeds</li>
<li><strong>transparent support for
scalability/reliability/redundancy</strong> (the points mentioned in the
beginning of the article)</li>
<li><strong>powerful hardware </strong>with low power usage but capable
of high loads</li>
<li><strong>encryption and certificates </strong>or** a chain of
trust**</li>
<li><strong>ipv6 </strong>- we need good endpoint communication
capabilities</li>
<li>****a clear understanding of where we want to put our personal data
and how we can protect it****</li>
</ul>
<p>i think each requirement on its own is already implemented somewhere
but not in combination to each. there is not yet a library providing the
software/protocol requirements and the hardware is either not powerful
enough or is not intended to be used in that way required.</p>
<h2 data-number="4" id="conclusion">conclusion</h2>
<p>still it is a long way for the private clouds to have the same level
of features/quality as the big clouds already have. <strong>for the time
being it seems to be complicated for the average internet user to use
the internet without loosing too much of his individuality</strong>,
thus the <strong>freedom of expression</strong>.</p>
